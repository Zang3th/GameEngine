## Introduction

SalinityGL is an OpenGL baselayer library for creating (2D/3D) visualization applications. The goal is to create a library that is easy to use and lightweight. SalinityGL provides a thin OpenGL abstraction layer and some basic helper functions to support the process of building rendering applications.

SalinityGL is written in C++17 with OpenGL 4.5. Currently, only Linux is supported. To get started, take a look at the [building and compiling](https://github.com/Zang3th/GameEngine/tree/master#building-and-compiling) section.

During development, several [demo applications](https://github.com/Zang3th/GameEngine/tree/master#demo-applications) were created to test the engine's capabilities. These apps are built and compiled separately from the engine core, but a global parameter file is maintained for the configuration of some *app-to-engine* settings.

The development of this library also serves my educational purposes.

SalinityGL is licensed under the [MIT LICENSE](https://github.com/Zang3th/GameEngine/blob/master/LICENSE).

## Demo applications

### GreenWorld

Nature scene with water rendering, normal mapped objects, and a particle system to display smoke.

### CellSim (on hold) âŒ›

3D Cellular Automata System (experimental - very primitive). Serves as a test and benchmark application for now.

### Liquefied (in development)

2D Eulerian Fluid Simulation on the CPU.

## Building and compiling

The engine and the demo applications are compiled separately. The engine is compiled into a static library and then included in the demo applications' binary. All external libraries ([Vendor/](https://github.com/Zang3th/GameEngine/tree/master/Vendor)) are getting directly included (via source) into the engine and need no separate install. The only exception is GLFW, which gets linked dynamically (.so file is provided).

### What you need

- Linux
  - Tested with Ubuntu 16.04 - 22.04
- C++17 compiler
  - Tested Clang and GCC
- CMake 3.20 or newer
- OpenGL 4.5 compatible graphics card and driver

### How to get started

- Install the external dependencies (if needed)

      apt-get install cmake pkg-config
      apt-get install libglu1-mesa-dev mesa-common-dev

- Clone/download the repository or a particular release

      git clone https://github.com/Zang3th/SalinityGL

- Debug configuration

      mkdir Build_Debug
      cd Build_Debug
      cmake .. -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -D CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-g"
      make -j

- Release configuration

      mkdir Build_Release
      cd Build_Release
      cmake .. -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -D CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-O3 -Wno-unused-but-set-variable -Wno-unused-result"
      make -j

- Run the demo applications
